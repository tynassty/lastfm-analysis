# lastfm-analysis

This is a small project that does a bit of data analysis on [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/home) data.

Right now, it can make a line chart of your most listened artists (cumulative or moving sum) and an interaction graph of your artists (i.e. a graph of the number of times you scrobble a given artist directly after another given artist).
